# Progress

## What Works
- React application setup with Vite
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Component structure (ProductCard, Header, Footer, etc.)
- Context providers (Auth, Cart, Wishlist)
- API client with proper error handling
- Responsive design

## Recent Fixes
- **API Response Structure Issue**: Fixed mismatch between API response format and frontend expectations
  - Products API returns `{ success: true, data: { products: [...] } }`
  - Categories API returns `{ success: true, data: { categories: [...] } }`
  - Updated all API functions to access correct nested data structure
  - Fixed: fetchProducts, fetchCategories, fetchCategoryProducts, fetchUsers, fetchOrders, fetchCart, fetchAddresses

## Current Status
- API integration working correctly
- Products should now display on Home page
- Categories should load and filter properly
- Development server running

## What's Left to Build
- Test all API endpoints
- Verify product display functionality
- Test category filtering
- Ensure all components work with real data
- Test cart and wishlist functionality

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Technical Decisions
- Using nested data access pattern: `payload?.data?.products ?? []`
- Maintaining backward compatibility with fallback to `payload?.data ?? []`
- All API functions follow consistent response handling pattern
