# Active Context

## Current Issue - RESOLVED ✅
Cart and Wishlist functionality has been successfully updated to integrate with real API endpoints.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Added cart API functions (addToCart, updateCartItem, removeFromCart)
- ✅ Added wishlist API functions (addToWishlist, removeFromWishlist, fetchWishlist)
- ✅ Added order creation API function (createOrder)
- ✅ Updated CartContext to use real API with localStorage fallback
- ✅ Updated WishlistContext to use real API with localStorage fallback
- ✅ Enhanced Cart page with real checkout process
- ✅ Added authentication checks for checkout
- ✅ Added proper error handling and loading states

## API Integration Details
- **Cart APIs**: Uses `/api/v1/cart` endpoints with JWT authentication
- **Wishlist APIs**: Uses `/api/v1/wishlist` endpoints (with localStorage fallback)
- **Order APIs**: Uses `/api/v1/orders` for checkout process
- **Authentication**: All cart/order operations require user login
- **Fallback Strategy**: If API fails, falls back to localStorage for better UX

## Key Features Added
- **Real-time Cart Sync**: Cart items sync with backend API
- **Authenticated Checkout**: Users must be logged in to place orders
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed operations
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API operations
- **Fallback Support**: Works offline with localStorage backup

## Test Credentials
- **Customer**: test@example.com / password123
- **Admin**: admin@shop.com / admin123

## Next Steps
- Test cart and wishlist functionality in browser
- Verify API authentication works correctly
- Test checkout process with real orders
- Ensure proper error handling for network issues

## Key Files Updated
- `/src/utils/api.js` - Added cart, wishlist, and order API functions
- `/src/context/CartContext.jsx` - Updated to use real API
- `/src/context/WishlistContext.jsx` - Updated to use real API
- `/src/pages/Cart.jsx` - Enhanced with real checkout process

## Technical Notes
- JWT tokens automatically included in API requests
- Cart operations require user authentication
- Wishlist has API integration with localStorage fallback
- Order creation includes proper error handling
- All operations have loading states and user feedback
